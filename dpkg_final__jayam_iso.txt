Servers
--------

PostgreSQL Server:

Object-relational SQL database
PostgreSQL is a fully featured object-relational database management system. It supports a large part of the SQL standard and is designed to be extensible by users in many aspects. Some of the features are: ACID transactions, foreign keys, views, sequences, subqueries, triggers, user-defined types and functions, outer joins, multiversion concurrency control. Graphical user interfaces and bindings for many programming languages are available as well.

MySQL Server :

MySQL database server -This is an empty package that depends on the current "best" version of mysql-server (currently mysql-server-5.1), as determined by the MySQL maintainers. Install this package if in doubt about which MySQL version you need. That will install the version recommended by the package maintainers.

MySQL is a fast, stable and true multi-user, multi-threaded SQL database server. SQL (Structured Query Language) is the most popular database query language in the world. The main goals of MySQL are speed, robustness and ease of use

Apache : 

The Apache Software Foundation's goal is to build a secure, efficient and extensible HTTP server as standards-compliant open source software. The result has long been the number one web server on the Internet.

It features support for HTTPS, virtual hosting, CGI, SSI, IPv6, easy scripting and database integration, request/response filtering, many flexible authentication schemes, and more

Squid:

Internet object cache (WWW proxy cache)

This package provides the Squid Internet Object Cache developed by the National Laboratory for Applied Networking Research (NLANR) and Internet volunteers. 

PHP : 
Server-side, HTML-embedded scripting language
This package is a metapackage that, when installed, guarantees that you have at least one of the three server-side versions of the PHP5 interpreter installed. Removing this package won't remove PHP5 from your system, however it may remove other packages that depend on this one.

PHP5 is an HTML-embedded scripting language. Much of its syntax is borrowed from C, Java and Perl with a couple of unique PHP-specific features thrown in. The goal of the language is to allow web developers to write dynamically generated pages quickly. This version of PHP5 was built with the Suhosin patch. 



EBOX:

common library used by eBox platform modules

eBox Platform is an open source small business server that can act as a Gateway, a Unified Threat Manager, an Office Server, an Infrastructure Manager, a Unified Communications Server or a combination of them. One single, easy-to-use platform to manage all your network services.

GNUSim8085 is a graphical simulator, assembler and debugger for the Intel 8085 microprocessor


QEDA:

GPL EDA -- Electronics design software

The gEDA project has produced and continues working on a full GPL'd suite and toolkit of Electronic Design Automation tools. These tools are used for electrical circuit design, schematic capture, simulation, prototyping, and production. Currently, the gEDA project offers a mature suite of free software applications for electronics design, including schematic capture, attribute management, bill of materials (BOM) generation, netlisting into over 20 netlist formats, analog and digital simulation, and printed circuit board (PCB) layout.

This is a metapackage which depends on the components required for a typical gEDA installation. 

PCB:

printed circuit board (pcb) design program

PCB is an interactive printed circuit board editor for the X11 window system. PCB includes a rats nest feature, design rule checking, and can provide industry standard RS-274-X (Gerber), NC drill, and centroid data (X-Y data) output for use in the board fabrication and assembly process. PCB offers high end features such as an autorouter and trace optimizer which can tremendously reduce layout time. 

Gresistor:

resistor color code calculator

To allow for identification, resistors are usually marked with colored bands. Often refered to as color codes, these markings are indicative of their resistance, tolerance and temperature coefficient. gResistor helps you translate resistor color codes into a readable value. All you have to do is watch the colors on the resistor and then enter them in the program. As you enter colours you'll see that the resistor value is changing accordingly. 

GtkWave:

a VCD (Value Change Dump) file waveform viewer

gtkwave is a viewer for VCD (Value Change Dump) files which are usually created by digital circuit simulators. (These files have no connection to video CDs!) 


Klogic:

digital circuit editor and simulator for KDE

KLogic is an application for building and simulating digital circuits easily.

It provides an easy way to build circuits containing standard components like AND, OR, XOR and flipflops like RS and JK. To build more complex and reusable circuits, you can create sub-circuits.

The simulation runs permanently by default while building your circuits. For extended testing you can use a single stepping simulation to recognise peaks. You can display the signal flow of the components of a circuit as a graph. Each device of your circuit has a tunable delay. With the burst option the delay of all devices can be disabled. 

Gwave:

a waveform viewer eg for spice simulators

Gwave is a tool for viewing analog data, such as the output of Spice simulations.

Gwave can read "raw" files from spice2G6, spice3F5 or ngspice, and a tabular ASCII format suitable for use with GnuCAP or homegrown tools. It can also read several binary and ascii files written by commercial spice-type simulators such as hspice, tspice, and nanosim.

It supports multiple "panels" (graticules) with multiple variables displayed in each. Two vertical-bar cursors are available for time-difference measurements. Multiple files can be loaded, for comparing results of several simulations. 

Ksimus:

KDE tool for simulating electrical circuits

KSimus is an application for simulating networks with boolean and floating point data type. Some more data types are planned. Currently there exists only a few components, but because of the modular character of KSimus extensions are easy to develop. 

Freehdl:

VHDL is a language standardized by the IEEE, intended for developing electronic systems.

GHDL implements the VHDL language according to the IEEE 1076-1987 or the IEEE 1076-1993 standard. GHDL compiles VHDL files and creates a binary which simulates (or executes) your design.

GHDL does not do synthesis: it cannot translate your design into a netlist. 


FreeMat(MATLAB):

mathematics framework (mostly matlab compatible)

FreeMat is a free environment for rapid engineering and scientific prototyping and data processing. It is similar to commercial systems such as MATLAB from Mathworks, and IDL from Research Systems, but is Open Source. FreeMat is available under the GPL license.

Besides research into speech synthesis, festival is useful as a stand-alone speech synthesis program. It is capable of producing clearly understandable speech from text.

Childsplay:


Suite of educational games for young children

Childsplay provides memory activities that are fun to play and at the same time learn sounds, images, letters and numbers; activities that train the child to use the mouse and keyboard and pure game activities like puzzles, pong, pacman and billiards. 


Gcompris:

Educational games for small children

A large collection of educational games for small children. It is meant to become some sort of unified interface to integrate more educational games.

Language-oriented games now contain vocabulary for too many languages to list them heres. Sounds and voices are also available for a number of languages, check the gcompris-sound packages for your language.

Currently available boards include:

 * learning how to use a mouse and keyboard
 * learning simple arithmetics
 * learning how to read an analog clock
 * recognize letters after hearing their names
 * reading practice
 * small games (memory games, jigsaw puzzles, ...)
 * etc.

It is designed so that it is easy to implement new boards to GCompris.

A number of boards are only available if other packages are installed, see the Suggests list for more details.
